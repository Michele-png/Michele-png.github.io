# Startup Market Validation
This repository contains the code and resources for the SalesForecasting project, which includes various methods for demand forecasting using Bayesian models and other statistical techniques.

## Overview
The SalesForecasting project aims to provide accurate and reliable demand forecasts for products. It utilizes Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and other machine learning techniques to analyze and predict sales trends. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model validation, and visualization of results.

## Context
In the dynamic landscape of start-ups, market validation is crucial to ensure the viability of new business ventures. This project focuses on the video games and electronic sports (eSports) industry, characterized by structured teams of professional gamers competing in global tournaments with millions of followers. The goal is to develop a software solution that leverages computer interaction data to predict the probability of developing musculoskeletal pathologies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

The software offers two potential commercialization strategies: licensing it to individual video gamers or selling it to professional eSport teams for monitoring the health of their electronic athletes. The project aims to validate the market potential of this innovative solution through a structured scientific approach. A questionaire with a visual explanation of the product MVP was distributed to gamers and to eSport teams, the analysis of its data allowed to estimate which market was larger for the product and thus, to depict the road ahead for the start up. In particular, to choose the best commercialization strategy, the potential gross revenue is analyzed using a threefold research approach involving Bayesian models. The impact of gamers' musculoskeletal conditions and their healthcare complaints on MVP purchase decisions, and the effect of rehabilitators' technological maturity and athletes' locomotory problems on managerial MVP acquisition are examined. The research suggests that selling to individual players is optimal.
