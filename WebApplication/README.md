<h2>JaidPhis Start up</h2>

<p>JaidPhis is a start up developing an AI model capable of analysing computer camera frames and diagnosing musculoskeletal disorder. Then, it can leverage this knowledge to devise a gamified recovery plan. To validate the B2B business model, a prototype was built and presented to HR directors. The following describes the MVP implementation.

<h3>Prototype Implementation</h3>
<p>As a matter of fact, no AI model was available to readily accomplysh the diagnostic task. To evade the matter, a twofold architecture was ideated. On the one side, the corporate client was to record himself for a minute with his laptop front camera. Then, this video was to be uploaded on the web application, which would display it back with postural lines overlaid. These lines are derived from a simplistic machine learning model existing in conventional python libraries. Given that the product would be presented during a video call, a cofounder would visually assess the posture of the HR responsible, and input a verbal description into an online database. Eventually, on the customer side, when the reproduction of the uploaded video is over, the app would pull the written feedback and display it as if it was the output of a multimodal model, thus simulating the functioning of the final product. Here follows a visual representation. </p>
